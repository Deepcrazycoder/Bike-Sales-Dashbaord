🚲 Unveiling My Latest Excel Dashboard Project: Bike Sales Analysis 📊



Just wrapped up an exciting data visualization project where I designed a dynamic Bike Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, Charts, and thoughtful UI design to derive actionable insights!



Key highlights from the dashboard:

✅ Average Income per Purchase by Gender – Discovered intriguing income trends across male and female customers.

 ✅ Bike Purchases by Age Brackets – Pinpointed which age groups are the most likely buyers.

 ✅ Commute Distance vs. Bike Purchase – Analyzed how daily commute distances influence the likelihood of owning a bike.

 ✅ Region-wise Bike Purchase Count based on Occupation – Analyzed which Occupation from which region is more interested in owning a bike. 



This project helped sharpen my data analysis, storytelling, and dashboard design skills – turning raw data into strategic insights.
